# Exercise 3: Create collections and exhibits in Omeka

## Self-guided exercises
1. [Add a new collection and associate appropriate items to collection](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar/tutorial/collections/2016/09/06/add-a-collection.html). Check out the [Omeka Sandbox](http://limestone.omeka.net/) to see sample items across [different collections](http://limestone.omeka.net/collections/browse). 
2. [Make an Exhibit](https://jaguillette.github.io/omekaSugar/tutorial/collections/2016/09/06/make-an-exhibit.html). For historical context about the collection, visit [the digital collection at IU's Image Collections Online](https://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/images/splash.htm?scope=images/VAC5094). And check out this brief [sample exhibit](http://limestone.omeka.net/exhibits/show/midwest) in the Omeka sandbox.
3. You may need to install/activate the Exhibit Builder plugin in your Omeka site: My Dashboard > Manage Site > Plugins > Click the green "Install" button.

As you work independently, let us know how you're doing by flagging your laptop using the sticky notes provided:

- :cool: **Green**. It's going great!
- :question: **Pink**. We're stumped.
- :100: **Blue**. I'm finished!

If you get stuck, first ask a fellow workshop participant how they worked through the roadblock you're encountering. Still stumped? Flag your laptop with the pink sticky. Help is on its way!

The sticky note strategy we learned about from Miriam Posner (see [A better way to teach technical skills to a group](http://miriamposner.com/blog/a-better-way-to-teach-technical-skills-to-a-group)), who in turn borrowed it from [Deb Verhoeven](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/deb-verhoeven).
