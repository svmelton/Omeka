# Exercise 4: Discuss collaborative roles of Omeka projects

Based on the previous exercises, you should now have a pretty strong sense of what it takes to create an Omeka project. In pairs, discuss the following questions:

1. Who are **potential collaborators** on your campus or in your communities?

2. What are the **skills and expertise** a project team would need to have to create an Omeka project?

3. What skills and expertise would **you bring** to an Omeka project?

4. What are possible **skill gaps** for which your project team might need to skill up or recruit additional members with complementary knowledge and skills?

To wrap up, pairs will share insights from their discussion with the larger group of all workshop participants.

A [handout of these discussion questions](https://github.com/tech-at-arl/Digital-Scholarship-Institute/blob/master/August%202018/Archives%20and%20Exhibitions/docs/exercise-4.pdf) [PDF] is also available.
